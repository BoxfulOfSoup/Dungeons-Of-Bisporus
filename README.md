<h1>Dungeons of Bisporus</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Dungeons of Bisporus is a project I started as my intro to Java, and also for a game jam, which ended before I finished it. The game is pretty broken and I lack the motivation to finish it.
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
The game involves delving through randomly generated dungeons with enemies and traps. Everything has a list of elements in this game with their own weaknessess and defensive capabilities. You can harness these elements by planting mushrooms near traps of the element.
<h3>Elements</h3>
